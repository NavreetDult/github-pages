*Scope and objectives of use case*
|||
| --- | --- |
| Scope | A local energy community - **please add** <br/> Networks: LV <br/> Markets: None|
| **Objective(s)** | * To enable local islanding. <br/> *To maximize consumption of locally produced *renewable* energy in geographic proximity. <br/> * To create a prerequisite for the advanced use cases 2 - 4|
| **Related business case(s)** |add text|

***Notes:***
* **Scope** - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text.
* **Objective(s)** - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline.
* **Realted business case(s)** - optional

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**

Use case 1 is anticipated to emerge as a result of the Clean Energy Package, driven by the bottom-up demand of customers and local communities. It is a prerequisite for the advanced use cases 2-4 which investigate ways to coordinate the interconnected distribution network with local energy communities.

**Complete description**

add text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about *what* happens *how*, *where*, *when*, *why* and *under which assumptions*. It has to be written in a way that it can also be understood by non-experts.

***Notes:***
* **Assumptions** - general presumptions about conditions or system configurations (e.g. customer's consent required for some steps; simulation of TSO)
* **Prerequisites** - specify which requirements have to be met so that the basis scenario use case can be successfully accomplished.

***Notes:***
* **Relation to other use cases** - relation to other use cases in the same project or thematic area. Possible relation types are for instance include, extend, invoke, or associate.
* **Level of depth** - reflects the degree of specialisation of the use case. Although no common notation is settled, descriptions like high level use case, generic, detailed, or specialised use case are often used.
* **Prioritisation** - helps to rate the use cases in a project from very important to nice-to-have with labels like obligatory/mandatory or optional which have to be agreed upon beforehand.
* **Generic, regional or national relation** - for the purpose of generalisation if use case is applied to areas where restictions by law or silimiar issues occur.
* **Nature of the use cases** - describes the viewpoint and field of attention like *technical, political, business/market, test*, etc.

***Notes***
This part describes the possible scenarios of the use case. The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.
* **Primary Actor** - the first actor appearing in the scenario at the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Triggering Event** - the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Pre-Condition** - indicates which terms have to be fulfilled for the scenario to be executed.
* **Post-Condition** - indicates which terms should be valid after the scenario. TIt can also specify whether a scenario has been successfully completed or not.

Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.
* **Event** - Event triggering a step, specific for that use case.
* **Name of Process/ Activity** - general classification of process/activity (e.g. data aquisition).
* **Description of Process/ Activity** - more detailed description of the step.
* **Service** - addresses the nature of the information flow. Possible: GET (The information receiver obtains information from the
information producer after an implicit request.), CREATE (The information producer creates an information object.), CHANGE (The information producer performs an update of the information at the information receiver’s.), DELETE (The information producer deletes information of the receiver.), CANCEL/CLOSE (A process is terminated.), EXECUTE (An action or service is performed.), REPORT (The information producer supplies information of its own account.), TIMER (The actor which represents both information producer
and receiver has to enforce a waiting period.), REPEAT (A number of steps has to be repeated until a break condition (stated in the field Event) is satisfied. The contemplated steps have to be added in parentheses.).
* **Information Producer and Receiver (Actor)** - actors from actor list in section 3.1
* **Information exchanged (IDs)** - ID of the information defined further in section 5
